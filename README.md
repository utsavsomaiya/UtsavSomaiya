My name is Ryan. I'm a Laravel and JavaScript developer from United Kingdom. I spend most of my time these days working with [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), as well as [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). This is commonly referred to as the "TALL stack".

### Projects

I spend a good amount of time each day working on open-source projects for a variety of different languages and frameworks. Below is a list of my favourite projects:

* [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/)
* [Orbit](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/orbit)
* [TALL Preset](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tall)
* [Alpine.js Clipboard](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/alpine-clipboard)
* [Alpine.js Tooltip](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/alpine-tooltip)
* [Prettier Plugin for Blade](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/prettier-plugin-blade)

### Writing

If I feel like something could be of use to other people, or perhaps my future self, I tend to write a [blog post about it on my blog](https://ryangjchandler.co.uk/).

### Socials

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryangjchandler). I don't use any other socials.
